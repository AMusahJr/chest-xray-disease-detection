Model Performance

The ResNet-50 model was trained for binary classification (Pneumonia vs Normal) on the NIH ChestXray14 dataset using transfer learning. Performance was evaluated on a held-out validation set using multiple decision thresholds.

At a threshold of 0.5, the confusion matrix was:
TP = 54
FN = 13
TN = 1429
FP = 3504


This corresponds to:
Sensitivity (Recall): 0.81
Specificity: 0.29
AUC: ≈ 0.59

Threshold analysis showed:

| Threshold | TP | FN | TN   | FP   |
| --------- | -- | -- | ---- | ---- |
| 0.4       | 67 | 0  | 0    | 4933 |
| 0.5       | 54 | 13 | 1429 | 3504 |
| 0.6       | 3  | 64 | 4760 | 173  |
| 0.7       | 0  | 67 | 4878 | 55   |
Lower thresholds resulted in high sensitivity but extremely poor specificity, while higher thresholds resulted in high specificity but failure to detect pneumonia cases.


ROC Curve: The ROC curve showed limited class separation, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of approximately 0.59, indicating weak discriminative performance.


Grad-CAM Visualization

Grad-CAM was applied to visualize model attention on chest X-ray images for:
True Positive
False Negative
True Negative
False Positive

Visualizations revealed that the model often focused on lung regions but also frequently attended to irrelevant areas such as rib edges and image borders, particularly for false positive predictions.
