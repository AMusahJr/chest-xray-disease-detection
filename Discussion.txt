The model demonstrates limited ability to distinguish between pneumonia and normal chest X-ray images. While sensitivity was relatively high at lower thresholds, this came at the cost of an extremely high false positive rate, making the model unsuitable for direct clinical deployment.

Several factors likely contributed to this behavior:
1. Label noise in ChestXray14 dataset: The dataset is weakly labeled using NLP extraction from radiology reports, which introduces inaccuracies.
2. Class imbalance: Pneumonia cases represent a small fraction of the dataset, biasing the model toward predicting the negative class.
3. Single-label simplification: The original dataset is multi-label, but the task was simplified to binary pneumonia detection, ignoring co-occurring diseases.
4. Limited training epochs and resolution: Computational constraints limited training duration and image resolution.

Grad-CAM visualizations indicate that the model does not consistently attend to pathological regions, suggesting insufficient feature learning.

Despite these limitations, the project demonstrates:
* End-to-end medical image classification
* Use of transfer learning
* Evaluation using ROC and confusion matrices
* Application of explainable AI (Grad-CAM)

Future work could include:
* Multi-label classification
* Better class balancing
* Training on higher resolution images
* Using DenseNet architectures proven effective for chest X-ray tasks
* Fine-tuning deeper layers
* Calibration of predicted probabilities
